# GADS20p
Practice project given during the Google Africa Developer Scholarship to show what we learnt so far
This project implements the mobile version of the [GADS 2020 leaderboard](https://community.andela.com/index.php/leadership-board/)
it reads from an api and displays top 20 learners in the Learning Leaders’ category and top 20 learners in the Skill IQ Leaders’ category.
Submission of the project is done using/implementing google form in app using its api
It follows the MVC architectural pattern and has a simple and sleek UI given to me by the [GADS team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l-huMnFzu0Lh_olBCzHgovsUCwbKouMb?usp=sharing) 
and follows all the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KS003bk1a-2bOfUnhXvnOPoHfPuKtdkTAQ_APljjgWc/edit) given
